# 👋 Hey there! I'm Harshit Sharma

I’m a passionate full-stack developer from India, currently exploring the depths of MERN stack development. I specialize in building complete web applications from scratch — from backend APIs to polished, responsive frontends.

Whether I’m crafting robust APIs, managing cloud uploads with Cloudinary, or building responsive React apps, I thrive on turning ideas into full-fledged products. I’m constantly learning, building, and seeking opportunities to grow and collaborate.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

A tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in JavaScript and modern web development. My recent work includes building a YouTube Clone as a capstone project, integrating advanced features like user authentication, video streaming, channel management, and comments — all with a seamless UX.

I enjoy solving problems, contributing to open-source, and working with scalable backend architectures using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I’m also keen on DevOps practices and CI/CD integration.
