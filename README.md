# 👋 Hey there! I'm Harshit Sharma

I’m a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** from India, with hands-on experience in building robust web applications using the **MERN stack**. From developing backend APIs to crafting polished, responsive frontends — I love turning ideas into scalable products.

Whether it's streaming video with Cloudinary, managing user authentication with JWT, or designing clean UI with React and TailwindCSS — I thrive in solving problems and building real-world applications.

- User authentication & session management  
- Channel and video management  
- Comments, likes/dislikes, and video search  
- Responsive design and real-time interactivity  

I also enjoy exploring DevOps tools, writing clean code, and working in Agile environments.
